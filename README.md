- DevOps engineers manage containers
- Containers run on cloud servers

## Simple Example (Conceptual)
Application → Docker Image → Container → Server (Linux / Cloud)


## Connection with Previous Topics
- Linux provides the OS for containers
- Git stores Dockerfile and app code
- AWS hosts containerized applications
