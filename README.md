# docker-basics

This repository contains my beginner notes and commands while learning Docker.

## Topics Covered
- What is Docker
- Images vs Containers
- Docker installation
- Basic Docker commands

## Common Commands
- docker --version
- docker images
- docker ps
- docker run
- docker stop

## Learning Outcome
- Understanding containerization
- Running first Docker container

## Why Docker?
Docker helps package applications with all their dependencies so they run the same everywhere.

## Problems Docker Solves
- Works on my machine issue
- Dependency conflicts
- Environment differences

## Core Concepts
- Image: Blueprint of an application
- Container: Running instance of an image
- Dockerfile: Instructions to build an image
- Registry: Stores Docker images (Docker Hub)

## Where Docker Fits in DevOps
- Developers build images
- DevOps engineers manage containers
- Containers run on cloud servers

## Simple Example (Conceptual)
Application → Docker Image → Container → Server (Linux / Cloud)

## Learning Goal
Build a clear foundation before running real containers.
